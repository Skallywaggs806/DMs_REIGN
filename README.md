### 🌟 What is Dungeon Master's R.E.I.G.N?

**R.E.I.G.N** is your trusty sidekick for Dungeons & Dragons, designed to lighten the load for Dungeon Masters of all levels! It’s packed with powerful tools to make your game sessions smoother, faster, and more exciting:

- **🎲 Roller of Dice**: Roll any dice combo in *XdY+Z* format with ease!  
- **⚔️ Encounter Generator**: Spawn a tailored group of enemies with health scaled to your party’s APL (Average Party Level).  
- **🗝️ Item Tracker**: Keep tabs on magical items handed out to your players.  
- **💰 Gold Generator**: Generate loot piles of gold based on encounter level and APL.  
- **🧑‍🎤 NPC Generator**: Create unique NPCs with ability scores and proficiencies in a snap.  

**R.E.I.G.N** isn’t here to replace you, oh mighty DM—it’s here to handle the tedious stuff, so you can focus on weaving epic tales! Built on the **Dungeons & Dragons 5e ruleset**, it saves all generated content to the `DM_Data` subdirectory for easy access later.
